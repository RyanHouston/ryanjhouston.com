    Step Time     Name               Description                         Step Temp

#### Yeast starter
No starter makes me a sad panda. I can't get to the LHBS during the week so I could pick up any yeast the day before brewday and didn't have time to make a starter.

#### Mash
- Prepare strike water with 5.05 gal @ 165F
- Desired Mash Temp was 152F, hit 153.5F, gave one more good stir and closed up the MLT at 1:15pm.
- Start drain first runnings at 2:15pm. Recirculate til clear, then drain into boil kettle with 1.25oz of Falconer's Flight hops.

#### Sparge (Two round batch sparge)
- Total sparge water: 4.5 gal
- First round sparge with 2.25 gal at 190F. Looking to bring grain bed up to 168-170F.
- Second round sparge with 2.25 gal at 170F.
