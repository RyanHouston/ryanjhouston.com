I have been brewing only all-grain batches for about the past 3-4 years. This
was an extract kit from Northern Brewer that I picked up to try and brew
more frequently by brewing extract batches on occasion since it takes less
time.

I conducted a full-boil starting with 7 gallons of water, planning to
boil off 1 gallon over 60 minutes and get 5.5 gallons into the fermenter. This
plan leaves me an extra 0.5 gallon to lose to trub in the bottom of the boil
kettle. After adding all the malt extract the volume in the boil kettle was
closer to 8 gallons. I knew this meant I now needed to plan for a 90 minute
boil to evaporate off that extra volume.

After boiling for 30 minutes I started my hop schedule. Everything went as
planned and I ended up with 5.5 gallons of 1.058 SG wort in the fermenter. The
target OG was 1.062 SG.

I pitched 2 packets of Wyeast 1056. One of them was 3 months old and the other
was 2 months old so I figured they should just get used before losing anymore
viability.
