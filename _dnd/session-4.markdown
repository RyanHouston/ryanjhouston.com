Start off making sure everyone levels up by rolling hit dice to increase their
Maximum Hit Points and understands the abilities gained at Level 2.
WizardSleeves and Gouranga should copy new spells to their spellbooks.

Check if any member of the party has any ties in Phandalin.

## Log

All players rolled hit dice to level up. The Wizard and Cleric did not yet have
enough money to learn new spells.

### Arrival / Lionshield Coster
The party arrived in Phandalin with *Sildar Hallwinter* and headed straight to
the Lionshield Coster to deliver the stolen supplies they found at the Cragmaw
hideout. The merchant, *Linene Graywind*, was appreciative and gave the group
50 gp. She tells the party about the Redbrands and that she refuses to sell to
them.

### Barthen's Provisions
The group then heads to Barthen's Provisions to deliver the cart of supplies
which is what brought them to Phandalin to begin with. Barthen gives them each
10 gp. Barthen also tells them of the Redbrands stirring up trouble and that
they frequent the Sleeping Giant taphouse.

### Stonehill Inn
Characters come in and sidle up to the bar for a drink. Toblen Stonehill tells
them about the Redbrands terrorizing the town and *Harbin Wester*, the
townmaster, has done nothing.

Party learns of the following side-stories:
  * *Sister Garaele*, overseeer of the Shrine of Luck, left town for a few days
    and returned wounded and exhausted.
  * *Daran Edermath* is a former adventurer and resides at the orchard at the
    edge of town.
  * A miner tells them that Orc raiders have been seen at the of Triboar Trail.
    The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.

### Edermath Orchard
Daran is concerned about the Redbrands. He is a retired adventurer. Tells the
group that it's time someone took out their leader, Glasstaff.

Also tells the group that people are reporting being chased by the undead away
from *The Old Owl Well* ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin. Knows
the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril.

### Sleeping Giant Taphouse
Group walks up to the Sleeping Giant and meets 4 Redbrand Ruffians on the porch
waiting for them. The group defeats them earning 100 XP each. Group investigates
the taphouse looking through the windows and decides to move on, as there are
far too many to fight.

### Alderleaf Farm
Stopping in to visit with Qelline Alderleaf, the Aunt of Dildo. Qelline seems
to know all the happenings in town and offers to let the group crash in the
hayloft.

Qelline's son, *Carp*, shows up and tells the group about seeing a group of
"big ugly bandits" coming out of a hidden tunnel near Tresendar Manor and
meeting with some Redbrands. Carp thinks they have a secret lair under the
Manor. He offers to take the characters there and provides them with directions.

Qelline learns that the group is looking for Cragmaw Castle and the Wave Echo
Cave. She suggests they go see *Reidoth the Druid* to ask for help telling them
"there's not an inch of land he doesn't know". Reidoth recently set out for the
ruins of a town called Thundertree just west of the Neverwinter Wood.
