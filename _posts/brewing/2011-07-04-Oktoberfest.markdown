Notes:
------
### Starter ###
Made a 1200ml starter with 1 Wyeast Munich Lager and an 800ml starter with the second Wyeast Munich Lager. 48 hours.

### Mash ###
Heat 4.4 gal to 166F. Let cooler preheat for 5 min. Looking for mash rest at 152-154F. Hit 153F on the money. 9:15am.
After 60 min mash temp right around 151F. Collected about 3 gal.

### Sparge ###
First round sparge with 2.75 gal at 200F. Brought grainbed up to 170-171F. Let sit 10 min before vorlauf and drain.

### Boil ###
Pre-boil 7.5 gal @ 1.043. Expected 7.5 gal @ 1.044. Not bad.
Just as boil started, realized I need a 90 min boil to drive off the DMS. Added .4 gal to get up to 8.1 gal to account for boil off. Boil started 12:05pm
7.8 gal @ 1.044 after 10 min boil... odd SG went up after adding

Immersion chiller outside only got down to 80F. Racked to carboy and put in fermentation cooler with ice and water at 2:30pm. SG 1.054.

### Fermentation ###
Fermented between 50-55F. Little higher than planned.
2011-07-17 - Hydro sample at 1.012.  Not as yeasty as expected. Expected less flocculation. Nice color. Taste has almost a toastiness to it. May have more ale esters than planned. Hard to say at this point especially with this being the first lager. Is that toastiness more like popcorn? Diacetyl? Going to pull it out for  D-rest now. Then rack to a keg for lagering in a day or so.

### Racking / Start Lagering - 2011-07-19 ###
Hydro sample still at 1.012.
Taste... first thought was "very phenolic". Not sure if that's the right term and never thought I knew what it was til now. Otherwise color is great and taste behind the phenols seems good but hard to tell.
