### Slave Pens + Captives
**Killed 2 Redbrands** to free three enslaved townsfolk, Mirna Dendrar and her
two teenage children, the family of Thel whose body was 1/2 eaten by the Nothic.
Tell the group of an emerald necklace left at their old place in Thundertree.
All they know of the hideout is the boss is there who is a wizard and he has
"tall, furry monsters with big ears" (bugbears) working for him.

### Armory
The group moves out of the slave pens through the north door of the crypt room
and enters an armory room. **Dildo and Wizard Sleeves grab light crossbows and
quivers of bolts**. The group, now at a dead-end, inspects the hallway and finds
a secret door opening into a storeroom/work area which is at the north end of
the crevasse/cave area where they entered the hideout.

### Crevasse Redux
Group walks on through the crevasse down to the hallway on the bottom west wall.
They ignore the door on the south end of the hall and listen at the north door.
