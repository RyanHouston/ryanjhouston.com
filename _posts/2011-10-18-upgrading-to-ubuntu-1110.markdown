## ASUS K52J Laptop

### Post-Upgrade Problems
Wireless could not connect after resuming from suspend.
    [include script to fix this]

Touchpad three-finger tap middle-click simulation is gone.


### Praises
Battery life seems to be longer. I am assuming this is due to a new version of the power status app.

The new Ubuntu Mono font is my new best friend.

## Mac Mini

### Post-Upgrade Problems
Would not boot the new kernel 3.0.0 the first few times. Appears it would boot for needed 10 or more minutes while some USB issue was hanging according to the logs. The problem can be avoided by unplugging the plug for the USB hub on my Das Keyboard.
