title: Finally creating my web presence
layout: post
---

It could not be put off any longer. This is long overdue. I have finally created a personal blog. I don't expect to be overly vocal here and I don't expect much interest from anyone (seriously, why are you reading this?).

The content of this blog will likely be a place to gather my own thoughts, document software development issues I tackle, and serve as a place to keep notes on my homebrewing experiments.

This site is a project to learn something new and have something useful as a result. This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
