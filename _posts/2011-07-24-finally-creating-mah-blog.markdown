It could not be put off any longer. This is long overdue. I have finally created
a personal blog. I don't expect to be overly vocal here and I don't expect much
interest from anyone (seriously, why are you reading this?).

The content of this blog will likely be a place to gather my own thoughts,
document software development issues I tackle, and serve as a place to keep
notes on my homebrewing experiments. I will likely be posting homebrewing
recipes and notes "retroactively" in the [Brewing topic](/brewing) of this site.

This site is a project to learn something new and have something useful as a
result. This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
