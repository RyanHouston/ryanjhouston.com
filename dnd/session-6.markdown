### Slave Pens + Captives
**Killed 2 Redbrands** to free three enslaved townsfolk, Mirna Dendrar and her
two teenage children, the family of Thel whose body was 1/2 eaten by the Nothic.
Tell the group of an emerald necklace left at their old place in Thundertree.
All they know of the hideout is the boss is there who is a wizard and he has
"tall, furry monsters with big ears" (bugbears) working for him.

### Armory
Did anyone take stuff from the armory? Spears, swords, crossbows, and bolts.
Party goes through secret door into the storeroom/work area which opens into
the crevasse/cave area.

### Crevasse Redux
Just walk on through the crevasse down to the hallway at the bottom west wall.
