  * Tresendar Manor (Redbrand Hideout)

Starting out:

  1. Review last session log
  2. Waking up at Alderleaf Farm. Message sent from town after people heard
     how the Redbrand Ruffians were dealt with. Townmaster requests them at the
     townhall to discuss the fighting.
     Request from Linene to stop by the Lionshield Coster.
  3. Offer help from Linene at the Lionshield Coster. Offer help to trade
     equipment for upgrades.
  4. Harbin Wester somewhat scolds them for fighting as he is scared of the
     Redbrands retaliating, but he also asks them to chase off the Orcs.
     Also run into Sildar Hallwinter there who encourages them to
     keep after the Cragmaw Goblins. Sildar first wants them to investigate
     Tresendar Manor to look into the disappearance of *Iarno Albrek*.
  3. So, where to?

## Log

While discussing plans of what to do next, Carp and Qelline come in and notify
the adventurers that word has gotten around about their fight with the Redbrands
and Townmaster Harbin wants to see them. Linene at the Lionshield Coster has
also sent a message that she would like to help them.

### Shrine of Luck (Sister Garaele)
Sister Garaele told the Adventurers of a Banshee and asked them to go find out
some information from the banshee

### Miner's Exchange (Halia Thronton)

### Townmaster's Hall (Harbin Wester + Sildar Hallwinter)
Ran into Sildar Hallwinter while passing the Townmaster's Hall. He asked them
to continue on to Cragmaw Castle to find Gundren, but also encouraged them to
checkout Tresendar Manor to look for Iarno Albrek and investigate the Redbrands.

### Redbrand Hideout
Adventurers arrive at the hideout and enter through the secret cave entrance
that Carp told them about. Immediately encounter a *Nothic* in the crevasse
area and defeat it. They find a *+1 Magic Sword* and some other treasure that
the Nothic had stashed away.

Found a secret door at the end of a hallway leading into what appeared to be
the entrance to the Hideout from within Tresendar Manor.

**Killed 3 Redbrands** in their bunk room and found a "go-bag" satchel hidden in
the cistern containing a potion of healing, potion of invisibility, 50 gp and
change of clothes.

Continued through hideout and fell through a trap of false floor before entering
crypt room and murdering the enchanted skeletons that did not attack because
the party was all wearing Scarlet Redbrand cloaks.

(end of sesession)
